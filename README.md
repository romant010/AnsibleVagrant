# Ansible Vagrant
A simple Vagrantfile for Ansible

### Prerequesits:
* Git
* Oracle Virtual box
* Vagrant

#


### Vagrantfile Job:
1. Creates an Ubuntu 18.04 VM with 2 CPU's and 2048 MB Ram memory
2. Installs Ansible

# 

### Initial setup:
1. Clone this repository:

    **$ git clone https://github.com/romant010/AnsibleVagrant.git**
    
2. Change directory to internal folder:    

    **$ cd AnsibleVagrant-master/Ansible/**
    
3. In **keys** folder - replace the priavte key with your server key (e.g. EC2)
4. In **hosts** folder:
    * Change the IP address to the IP address of the machine/s you want to control.
    * Change the user name to the user name of the machine/s you want to control
5. Start nachine:

    **$ vagrant up**
    
6. SSH into machine

    **$ vagrant ssh**
    
7. Run:

    **$ sudo ansible all -m ping**
    
#

### Importana notes:
1. If the machine was already provisioned (you ran vagrant up in the past), you will need to override the **private.pem** located inisde **/etc** folder by running: $ **sudo mv /etc/ansible/keys/private.pem /etc/private.pem** and then $ 
**sudo chmod 400 /etc/private.pem** 
(This is a nasty workaround for beating non-posix systems which chmoding won't work e.g. windows).

2. In case, the machine uses python3, you will need to add the python interpreter version to your host/s:
 192.168.99.100 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=private.pem ansible_user=ec2-user **ansible_python_interpreter=python3**
